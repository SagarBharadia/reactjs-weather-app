## Background of project

After having learnt ReactJS for my university dissertation to create the frontend clients for a Help Desk SaaS, I fell in love with the simplicity and order. Having learnt and using it in haste, I decided to go back a couple notches and learn it properly, the 'React' way. I'm sure this is one of many projects i'll be developing in this process and I hope it helps other developers the same it does me :)

This project will utilise the [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/) to gather the data required.

(More sources will be added on as needed and required.)
